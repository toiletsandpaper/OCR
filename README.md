# Few words
Very simple OCR, made with RAD Studio

## Usage:
1. Draw a character in left window
2. Push `Transform` button
3. Push `Check` button
4. If it outputs "None" or incorrect letter - type correct letter bottom edit-field and push `SaveXML` button
5. Push `Clear` button and try again :)

## Probably don't work because "Untitled1.xml" cannot be found. Fix it on your own.
